# Particle Filter- Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program

### Overview

This repository contains all the code needed to complete the final project for the Localization course in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

### Project Introduction

Your robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data.

In this project 2 dimensional particle filter is implemented in C++. The particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step the filter will also get observation and control data. 


### Running the Code

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and intall uWebSocketIO for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu to install uWebSocketIO.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./particle_filter

Alternatively some scripts have been included to streamline this process, these can be leveraged by executing the following in the top directory of the project:

1. ./clean.sh
2. ./build.sh
3. ./run.sh

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

Here is the main protcol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.

INPUT: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

// sense noisy position data from the simulator

["sense_x"] 

["sense_y"] 

["sense_theta"] 

// get the previous velocity and yaw rate to predict the particle's transitioned state

["previous_velocity"]

["previous_yawrate"]

// receive noisy observation data from the simulator, in a respective list of x/y values

["sense_observations_x"] 

["sense_observations_y"] 


OUTPUT: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

// best particle values used for calculating the error evaluation

["best_particle_x"]

["best_particle_y"]

["best_particle_theta"] 

//Optional message data used for debugging particle's sensing and associations

// for respective (x,y) sensed positions ID label 

["best_particle_associations"]

// for respective (x,y) sensed positions

["best_particle_sense_x"] <= list of sensed x positions

["best_particle_sense_y"] <= list of sensed y positions

### Inputs to the Particle Filter
You can find the inputs to the particle filter in the `data` directory. 

#### The Map*
`map_data.txt` includes the position of landmarks (in meters) on an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system. Each row has three columns
1. x position
2. y position
3. landmark id

### All other data the simulator provides, such as observations and controls.

> * Map data provided by 3D Mapping Solutions GmbH.

### Algorithm

The particle filtering algo implemented is organized as follows:

1) Initialize a set of particles with positions and headings that are randomly distributed with a Guassian distribution around the initial GPS coordinates and assign equal weights to all of them.

2) Process incoming sensor measurement data due to motion with velocity an yaw rate information and update the state variables of the particle filter with a randomly added noise to simluate measurement noise.

3) Process incoming Observations of Landmarks an transform them into the Map Coordinate System.

4) On a per particle basis,

   4.1) Ignore Landmark Observations which are beyond the sensor range of each particle.
   
   4.2) Associate Landmark Observations to Real world Landmark postions and Update the weight of each particle.
   
5) Resample from the current set of particles based on their weights.

### Result

Below is the short snap of the particle filtering simulation where the blue circle indicates the localization of the car and the blue and green lines show the true and predicted associations of received landmark observations to map landmarks.
